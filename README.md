This repository contains my code for my HECNN, HPCNN, and HRICNN models.
All 3 models are part of the Real Time HAI product (in development currently).

Initial data is provided as a zip file called BRTK_SHIPS_2000to2019_IMERG_OK_Request_2023_FINAL.csv.zip.
The repository contains all the scripts needed to process the data and train the models.
There are also scripts to convert publicly available IMERG data into the format needed for the models.
